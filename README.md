# CRUD
Crud in Python using frameworks : streamlit, pandas and mysql connector. Have the 4 options in the server : Create, Read, Update and complete, all 100% working. 

To run the server use streamlit run main.py, and change the sql connection to your DB.

I use pandas to read the mySQL tables and show it in the server as a DataFrame

Use streamlit to forms in the server, mySQL to connect to DB 

So basically the most difficulty was Update, because i have to change de Create(include) code. The main.py is easy to understand
